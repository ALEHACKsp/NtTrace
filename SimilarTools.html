<title>Similar Tools to NtTrace</title>
</head>

<body>

There are other tools for Windows that provide a similar sort of functionality to NtTrace.
<br>
Here is a short list of some such, with some personal views of their advantages and disadvantages.
<p>
Note that <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> provides Unix-like strace functionality, but <i>only</i> for Cygwin binaries.

<h3>Strace for NT from BindView</h3>

<h4> Bindview was purchased by Symantec, it can be found on the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070915180821/http://www.bindview.com/Services/razor/Utilities/Windows/strace_readme.cfm">archive.org</a> web site</h4>

(Thanks to Yong Huang for this link)

<ul>
<li>- Installs a device driver, so must be an administrator
<li>- Must reboot to uninstall
<li>+ Comes with source
</ul>
